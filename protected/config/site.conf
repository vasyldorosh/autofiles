<p>Are you interested in the performance data along with engine specifications? Then you are at the right time and place! Here we share the top trade secrets about starting regimes and how acceleration 0 to 60 times works in particular&hellip;</p>

<p>You may have probably known that run-up time parameter depends on the fuel type, tire trend, extra weight, road condition, and many more essential factors. So, which one will alter your automobile acceleration results?</p>

<p>Our professional mission is to provide every auto enthusiast with useful and updated information on different specs for either new or used car models. If you are looking for the most accurate, but reasonable numbers, this automotive website is directed toward the goal of having really competent data online!</p>

<p>Welcome, dear car enthusiast, curious how fast your &lsquo;iron horse&rsquo; goes!</p>

<h3>How Does it Works?</h3>

<p>Measuring the vehicle&rsquo;s 0-60 speed is usually done in some closed setting by professional drivers. Each variable &ndash; wind, weather, or traction &ndash; can have a dramatic impact on the overall acceleration time recorded. The crew attaches precise measuring tools (Doppler radar guns &amp; precise timing instruments) to computers, and the test-driver is not worried about exact moment of hitting 60 miles per hour. His task is to focus solely on driving fast and straight. The car is timed going in 2 separate and opposite directions; and these 2 times are averaged together for the commonly accepted 0-60 figure. Typically, automobile magazines post the run-up time achieved in such testing. Indeed, acceleration time is a very useful measurement of an automobile power, if it&rsquo;s been reported by a reputable source.</p>

<p>7 Trade Secrets to Know about Acceleration Numbers</p>

<ol>
	<li>0-60 times is a performance measure commonly used for automotive acceleration from 0 to 60 mph, from 0 to 97 km/h, or from 0 to 27 m/s either in the United States or in the United Kingdom. The rest of the world practices 0 to 100 km/h, that said 0 to 62.5 mph.</li>
	<li>Actually, less than 1% of all 0-60 mph time numbers determines auto stats. In 99% cases, 0-60 times will be converted to 0-62 acceleration data. Please note this fact!</li>
	<li>Most people do not understand that run-up time is concluded by a number of automotive authorities from all over the world. Still, these and those numbers are never an absolute science. On the one hand, a tested car may arrive at a different result, despite all the variables have been kept the same in each acceleration test. On the other hand, a classic car, a luxury car, a sports car, a muscle car, a hybrid car, an exotic car or whatever is almost certain to demonstrate a different 0 to 60 result too, because the acceleration test has not been performed with exact same variables.</li>
	<li>As you can see, each 0 to 60 mph test will be significantly different by each source. What&rsquo;s more, non-professional tests conducted by amateur car drivers are the most inaccurate, in fact. The collective philosophy of auto gurus is to provide a range of acceptable, rather than popular finite run-up time results. For example, the acceleration rate should be listed as 3.2, 3.6&hellip; to 4.0, 4.2&hellip; seconds &ndash; it&rsquo;s the best way to balance all the amateur and professional tests for each vehicle.</li>
	<li>Present performance cars achieve their 0 to 60 mph in less than 6 seconds, whereas exotic cars accelerate in between 3 and 4 seconds. Currently, the fastest production street car is Bugatti Veyron Super Sport that reaches 60 mph from a stop in 2.46 seconds!</li>
	<li>Your own automobile may show different performance data, compared with absolute measurements. Keep in mind that a number of factors are to be considered when analyzing 0 to 60 stats. They include but are not limited to the following: vehicle tune, type of a driver, amount of fuel, race track surface condition, barometric pressure, engine &amp; outside air temperature, etc. Typically, an average of the best 2 runs in each direction (so as to eliminate the wind factor) determines the final estimate of 0 to 60 times. A reliable resource means that acceleration data works unless the technology improvement like transmission enhancements, power output, and AWD system, affecting the performance specs of cars.</li>
	<li>With new vehicles appearing here and there, 0-60 time estimation may turn out quite far from actual auto specs. Please have in mind that some car companies regulate their data later. In most cases, 0-60 times figures improve each year for particular car models. But, a vehicle&rsquo;s performance can decrease as well, due to more &ldquo;bells and whistles&rdquo; instead of engine enhancements.</li>
